## What is SpaceGlider?

SpaceGlider is a custom built Java game loosely based on the retro Asteroids arcade game. The application offers a simple and easy to use interface with buttons to start/pause the game. There are a total of 20 waves of asteroids with unique power-ups and extra lives along the way. The player begins with 3 lives and upon crashing into an asteroid will lose a life. Each wave becomes increasingly more difficult with randomized asteroids/abilities and an increasing pace of the game. Survive till the final wave to complete the game and blow up the enemy asteroid planet!

## Some Unique Features:
- Powerups have randomized chances of being released on certain waves. Some unique powerups include: extra lives, decreased size, increased speed, and invisibility.
- The game also includes randomized anti-power-ups which cause negative effects to the player including: increased size, and decreased speed. 
- Each wave has its own background telling a unique story throughout the game. An indicator in the top right corner tells the player the wave number after each wave.
- The positions of asteroids are randomized each wave, and the order of asteroids that are released is also randomized, with a possibility of diagonal movement.
